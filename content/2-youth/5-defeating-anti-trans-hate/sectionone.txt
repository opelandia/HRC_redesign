Title: Defeating Anti-Trans Hate

Seeking Acceptance and Freedom from Fear 

Transgender people are more visible in the United States than ever before — yet far too many remain targets of hatred and violence. HRC is shining a spotlight on discrimination against transgender people and threats to their safety.
In 2015, we partnered with the Trans People of Color Coalition to produce Addressing Anti- Transgender Violence: Exploring Realities, Challenges and Solutions for Policymakers and Community Advocates — a tool to document hate crimes and murders of transgender people and find ways to end transphobia and eliminate the victimization of this vulnerable community.
Every year, on Nov. 20, we memorialize people who have lost their lives at the Transgender Day of Remembrance. TDOR events take place all over the United States and around the world — India, Brazil, South Africa and elsewhere.
The HRC Foundation is giving voice to parents who support their transgender children — and encouraging others to do the same — through “Moms for Transgender Equality” and “Dads for Trans Equality,” a video series highlighting families’ experiences raising and protecting their children. These videos have been viewed more than 7.5 million times since their release in 2015.

Aside: In 2015, U.S. Congressional allies formed the Transgender Equality Task Force. In testimony before the group, HRC President Chad Griffin called violence against transgender people “an epidemic that’s raging across the country and ravaging our communities.”
