Title: Resources on LGBTQA+ Youth

----

Text: 

Today, our movement for full equality faces new and enormous challenges on multiple fronts. Now—more than ever—we are ready to fight for the equal rights and fundamental dignity that all LGBTQ people deserve.And thanks to you, the Human Rights Campaign is leading the way forward. HRC is at the forefront of the fight in the U.S. Congress for the Equality Act—historic federal legislation that would finally end the unacceptable patchwork of non-discrimination laws across this country that threaten the livelihoods of LGBTQ Americans.

But we’re not just fighting for our rights, we’re also fighting to protect our rights. As our opponents work to pass state legislation targeting LGBTQ people, we’re working to defeat hateful bills in states across this country that seek to write discrimination into the law and undermine our hard-won progress. And we’re mobilizing and organizing to elect more pro-equality candidates up and down the ballot.

Most of all, we’re working to break down the walls of hate and discrimination that continue to hold us back, and put too many at risk. In the wake of the tragedy in Orlando, we can’t afford to let up in stomping out hate wherever it is allowed to persist. Ultimately, the hatred that motivated this attack in Orlando is the same hatred that killed Matthew Shepard. It is the same hatred behind the killings at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, the murders of three Muslim students in Chapel Hill and the massacre at a Sikh Temple in Wisconsin. And it is this hate we must work to defeat each and every day. Because we are Muslim. We are Jewish. We are women. We are black, white, Latinx, Asian and Native American. We are immigrants and we are people with disabilities. Our community is as diverse as the fabric of our nation. And we have all come too far and fought too hard to allow hatred to drag us backwards.

The support of leaders like you have allowed HRC to reach for new heights. By standing with us, you make us stronger. Together, there is nothing we can’t achieve. Thank you for your support.

Intro: 

***“As a nation, we cannot say we are committed to equality, if we do not mandate equality for every citizen. You cannot have equality for some in America and not equality for all. This is another major step down a very long road toward the realization of a fair and just society. We should embrace the decision of the United States Supreme Court. It is now the law of the land.”***

Congressman John Lewis, 6/26/2015

The deck is stacked against young people growing up lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender in America. Official government discrimination or indifference along with social ostracism leaves many teens disaffected and disconnected in their own homes and neighborhoods. With an increase in public awareness about anti-LGBT bullying and harassment and the strikingly high number of LGBT youth who are homeless, in foster care, or living in high-risk situations, it is critical that we get a better understanding of the experiences, needs, and concerns of LGBT youth. 

This groundbreaking research among more than 10,000 LGBT-identified youth ages 13-17 provides a stark picture of the difficulties they face. The impact on their well-being is profound, however these youth are quite resilient. They find safe havens among their peers, online and in their schools. They remain optimistic and believe things will get better. Nevertheless, the findings of Growing Up LGBT in America are a call to action for all adults who want to ensure that young people can thrive.

With more than 10,000 survey respondents, this is the largest known sample of LGBT youth from every region of the country, from urban, suburban and rural communities, and from a wide variety of social, cultural, ethnic, and racial backgrounds.
As the first in a series of reports analyzing the landscape for LGBT youth, the goal of this document is to summarize the major findings from a general analysis of all survey responses. Over the next several months, the Human Rights Campaign will be engaging in additional analysis that will provide a better understanding of the unique experiences of specific groups of youth, for example those living in conservative states, transgender youth, those of different races, religious traditions, and so on.

HRC is thankful to The Trevor Project for its partnership in promoting the survey, along with dozens of local and state LGBT youth-serving organizations.
